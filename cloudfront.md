# Use Cases
When you add field-level encryption, you can protect specific data throughout system processing in addition to HTTPS security, so that only certain applications at your origin can see the data.

Running serverless code at the edge 

Using Lambda@Edge can help you configure your CloudFront distribution to serve private content from your own custom origin, in addition to using signed URLs or signed cookies.

The CloudFront managed prefix list contains the IP address ranges of all of CloudFront's globally distributed origin-facing servers. If your origin is hosted on AWS and protected by an Amazon VPC security group, you can use the CloudFront managed prefix list to allow inbound traffic to your origin only from CloudFront's origin-facing servers, preventing any non-CloudFront traffic from reaching your origin.
